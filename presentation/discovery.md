# Discovery Questions for New Business Meeting at Weavieate

1. How do customers currently search your website today?
(Are you using semantic search, keyword matching, tokenization, or something else?)

2. Where has your current solution fallen short?
(Any examples of poor search results, long-tail failures, or gaps in categorization?)

3. You mentioned an uncategorized product list — how is that data structured today?
(Free-text descriptions? Placeholder categories? Are any heuristics applied?)

4. How do you onboard new products, and how frequently does your catalog change?
(Batch imports, vendor feeds, manual entry? Daily, weekly?)

5. Do you currently use any embeddings or recommendation models?
(For search, personalization, or product similarity?)

6. How familiar is your team with AI/ML tooling?
(Are you using tools like SageMaker, Vertex AI, custom pipelines, etc.?)

7. Do you use any other SaaS platforms in your stack today?
(This helps us understand your integration needs and architectural preferences.)

8. How much raw product data are you storing today, excluding indexes?
(Rough size in GB or TB? Number of records? Helps size vectorization scope.)

9. Tell me about your expected query patterns.
(For a customer-facing app, what’s the expected QPS and concurrency?)

10. What are your performance expectations or SLAs for search?
(Do you have a target latency per query? Is it real-time or best-effort?)
